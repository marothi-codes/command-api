# ASP.Net Core Commands REST API App with Tests & an Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline

This is a basic ASP.Net Core Web API app that is focused on being as "RESTful" as possible, remaining as testable, scalable and as maintainable as possible. The Unit testing project is also in the repo.

A fun little project to sharpen one's Web API muscle.
